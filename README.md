BookScraperTwo is a project that i built to familarize myself with the selenium framework 

Whats does it do?

BookScraper will go to my uni's registration site, find a major, find a class, get the textbook data, and from the univesity's bookstore site, copy the booktitile and enter it in search engine were a free pdf verison of the book can be downloaded
