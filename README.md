# selenium
i just started learning selemium 
this is a script that opens google and signs in, it doesn't work for me on safari, says that the browser isn't safe

the end goal is to write a long script that downloads free pdf's of textbooks for the core classes of the top ten popular majors at my uni 

date:May 15
BookscraperTwo.py is the first installation of my script to download textbooks, 

Whats does it do?
It will go to the uni's registration site, find a major, and get info on all the textbooks used in the core classes of said major, load that data into a 
search engine where that textbook can be downloaded for free
