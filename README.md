# selenium
i just started learning selemium 
the earliest file  is a script that opens google and signs in, it doesn't work for me on safari, says that the browser isn't safe

BookscraperTwo.py is my script to download textbooks, 

Whats does it do?
It will go to my uni's registration site, find a major, and get info on all the textbooks used in the core classes of said major, load that data into a 
search engine where that textbook can be downloaded for free
