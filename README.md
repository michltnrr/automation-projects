Projects:

- bookScraper
- botshopper


what they do:


- Bookscraper
    - goes to my uni's registration site
    - finds major 
    - finds class within major 
    - gets textbook data on class
    - goes to pdf site, copies data into search bar
    - downloads book 

- botShopper (unfinshed because safari doesn't work w selenium anymore, and ion have a compatible driver for my version of chrome)
  - asks user what site the wanna shop from & item they wanna purchase
  - searches for item and purchases it
