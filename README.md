Projects:

- bookScraper
- botshopper
- bloxstalk
- botify


what they do:


- Bookscraper (spaghetti code ðŸ’€)
    - goes to my uni's registration site
    - finds major 
    - finds class within major 
    - gets textbook data on class
    - goes to pdf site, copies data into search bar
    - downloads book 

- botShopper (may not work, site will most likely have bot blocking software)
  - asks user what site the wanna shop from & item they wanna purchase
  - searches for item and purchases it

- bloxstalk
  - bloxstalk is a program that allows user to find when another player is online, the user provides the information on the player they're searching, and their own login data, then we search for the person they're looking for and send an email if they're online
 
- botify
   - botify allows people who don't have spotify premium to bypass ads by closing and reopening the app using their voice, and performing other actions such as skipping and pausing a song (doesnt work good because its gonna be ran while the app is open and playing music which interferes with the mics ability to pick up the users voice over the music, i tried to mitigate it but its iffy, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't)
